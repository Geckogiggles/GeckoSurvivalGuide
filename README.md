# GeckoSurvivalGuide


## Description


This is the guide to get you through the Pre-work of starting a journey as a Gecko (AKA a person who is bewildered by life and the neat things you can learn from it).

As a Gecko naturally does, I started a coding journey with a bootcamp course that taught me a lot of things. 

I wanted to share some of these things inside this neat little website with simple graphics.

I learned how to use elements and properties of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and even Git and Git flow to make this all happen.

This website and project helps me with my memory issue because now I have a consildated and adjustable place to store my notes and share them with other lost Geckos as well. 

I would love for people to actually use this website to help them succeed in this bootcamp.

I learned a lot about Git flow and I actaully am really excited about it because as a developer it is something that is used form day to day.

I also learned how to change styles of fonts, colors, and structure bodies of text in an html website.

I learned how to order things correctly in Java Script because it makes a world of a difference where you write the things since it computes sequentially.

 I would like to thank my loads of coffee, my faith, and my puppy for this moment. (Also my parents who helped pay for my tuition). These beautiful people were my motivation. I also cannot forget my amazing Bes Fren who made this desk possible because he built it at midnight the day before deployment.//
